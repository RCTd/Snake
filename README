This is a combined (mainly mine) effort at making a cross-platform version of Snake!

DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------
To compile, you will need:
-Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
-SDL SDK (http://www.libsdl.org/)
-SDL Runtime (http://www.libsdl.org/)

To work with the audio files, you'll need a MIDI editor (I'm using Finale 2011)
