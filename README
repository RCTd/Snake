This is a combined (mainly mine) effort at making a cross-platform version of Snake!

--------------------------------------------
THE GAME
--------------------------------------------
So far, it's really not much. There are flags and constants scattered
throughout which dictate some of the gameplay (mainly in GameWorld.cpp and
Snake.cpp), as well as the music flag in Music.hpp. Additionally, there are
a few game-changing flags in GameWorld.hpp, including game style and number
of walls.

Survival: Try to avoid hitting all the small, purple mines which spawn. Get
points for the amount of time you manage this.

Regular: Try to survive for as long as possible, eating food as you go. Different
food has different effects on your snake, as well as on your points.

--------------------------------------------
LANGUAGE
--------------------------------------------
This is written in C++ with Boost & SDL, with the nonstandard addition
of #pragma once, due to common usage. As far as I'm aware, everything else
is standards-conformant and should compile & run on any platform.

--------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------
To compile, you will need:
-Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
-SDL SDK (http://www.libsdl.org/)
-SDL Runtime (http://www.libsdl.org/)

To work with the audio files, you'll need a MIDI editor (I'm using Finale 2011)
